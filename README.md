# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Setup

Install the required dependencies (ex: `pymongo`) in a python venv.

To run the backend, `cd` into the app folder like so:

```sh
cd backend/app
```

and run the flask app with

```sh
flask --app main run
```

Your application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
